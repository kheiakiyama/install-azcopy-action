## How to publish

(This repository intentionaly include `dist/` directory. It is used by users.)  
Write description about changes.  
Determine version name as `v(x.x.x)`.
2. Update `v(x)` tag for compatibility or create `v(x)` major version tag with following commands.
```
git tag -fa v1 -m "Update v1 tag"
git push origin v1 --force
```
