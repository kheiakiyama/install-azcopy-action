## requirements
- node: v16.20.2
- npm: 8.19.4
- typescript: 4.9.5

## Code in Master

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript
```bash
$ npm run build
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  
```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try { 
      ...
  } 
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos.  We will create a releases branch and only checkin production modules (core in this case). 

Use linux or Mac environment instead of windows.

```bash
$ git fetch
$ git checkout -b master origin/master
$ git checkout -b releases/v1 origin/releases/v1
$ git merge master
$ npm install
$ npm prune --production
$ git add node_modules
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing the releases/v1 branch

```yaml
uses: actions/typescript-action@releases/v1
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and tested action

```yaml
uses: actions/typescript-action@v1
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```
